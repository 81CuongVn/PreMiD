## FAQ &middot; Frequently Asked Questions

> ## Why can't i install it on the **Chrome Web Store**?<br>

- Because i need to activate my google account as a Developer account but that requires **5$** and i am not paying it until i receive donations for this Project. (Donation link soon.)

> ## Is this project still up to date?<br>

- Yes! I use and work on this program and extension almost everyday!<br>There are currently no plans on discontinuing this Project.

> ## Will this project stay free?<br>

- Of course! Its open source! But i would highly appreciate a little bit of Money to activate the Google Developer Account so that i can put the Chrome extension on the Chrome Web store. And it would help me to get the money needed for future plans like a **Driver license** ðŸ˜Ž
